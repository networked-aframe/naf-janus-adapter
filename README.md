# Networked-AFrame Janus Adapter

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/naf-janus-adapter.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/naf-janus-adapter)

Network adapter for [networked-aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) that uses the Janus WebRTC server as a backend.

## Usage

naf-janus-adapter needs access to networked-aframe's `NAF` global variable. Include it **after** including networked-aframe but **before** the `networked-scene` is loaded.

## Compatibility

naf-janus-adapter should support anything that supports recent WebRTC standards (right now, the `RTPSender`-based APIs for manipulating streams and tracks). At the time of this writing, that means that many browsers (e.g. Chrome) will require the use of the [WebRTC adapter shim](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter). If you're using NPM to build your A-Frame application, you should include [webrtc-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webrtc-adapter) as a dependency of your application; if you're using the [browser distribution](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-janus-adapter/tree/master/dist), you should include the WebRTC adapter prior to including naf-janus-adapter, as shown in the example code below.

```

Compared to other adapters like easyrtc, the janus adapter has a specific API,
you need to call `NAF.connection.adapter.setClientId` and
`NAF.connection.adapter.setLocalMediaStream`, see the [Audio example](examples/index.html)
and the [Audio with Camera example](examples/audio-with-camera.html).

The `audio:false` on the `networked-scene` is not supported by this adapter.
If you want to mute the mic, you need to use
`NAF.connection.adapter.enableMicrophone(false)`

A specific behavior of the janus adapter is that `connect()` returns a
Promise (it's not the case with the easyrtc adapter).
The Promise returns when all peer connections to the participants are
established. So you can use this:

```js
AFRAME.scenes[0].components["networked-scene"].connect().then(() => {
  // do something
});
```

`getMediaStream` supports a second parameter to get the video stream instead of
the default "audio" stream. To get the video stream of a participant:

```js
const stream = await NAF.connection.adapter.getMediaStream(clientId, "video")
```

## Migrating to 4.0.0

4.0.0 allows the application to control when occupants are subscribed to. Occupants are no longer automatically subscribed to when they join. The application is now required to call `syncOccupants` and pass an array of `occupantId`s that it wants to subscribe to. This list should contain all `occupantsId`s that are currently desired to be subscribed to- including any that have already been subscribed to and want to continue to be so. Any occupants not on the list that are already subscribed to will be unsubscribed from. 
```js
NAF.connection.adapter.syncOccupants(arrayOfOccupantIds);
```

If you want to automatically subscribe to occupants on join, you may call `syncOccupants` with the `availableOccupants` array as the first argument once in the `onConnect` function.
```js
NAF.connection.adapter.syncOccupants(NAF.connection.adapter.availableOccupants);
```

or set `requestedOccupants` to be the same array instance as `availableOccupants` in the `adapter-ready` event listener if this is more convenient for you:

```js
scene.addEventListener('adapter-ready', ({ detail: adapter }) => {
  // We don't use the syncOccupants API, set requestedOccupants to be the same array instance as availableOccupants
  adapter.requestedOccupants = adapter.availableOccupants;
  ...
});
```
